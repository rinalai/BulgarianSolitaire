# BulgarianSolitaire
simulator for a game of Bulgarian Solitaire.

The game starts out by dividing a deck of s cards into p piles of cards, with a random number of cards in each pile.
In each subsequent round, a card is taken from each pile, and added to the end as a new pile.
The game terminates when there are piles of 1,2,3,...,m in any order, where s must be expressed as m*(m+1)/2 [ie. a triangular number].

###BulgarianSolitaireSimulator.R
simulates a user inputed number of trials, and outputs a dataframe of the distribution of number of rounds it takes for the game to terminate in each trial. Also outputs a barplot for each set of trials.
